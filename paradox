  <br><h1>The Paradox of Contradiction</h1>
  <!-- July 2023 -->
  <hr>

  <p>
  From a purely surface level, contradiction and paradox could easily be considered one and the same.
  On closer inspection however, they could hardly be more different.
  In fact, a more accurate evaluation would find them to be total and complete opposites.
  Here's why.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  When dealing with both contradiction and paradox, two statements are brought together which fundamentally negate each other.
  Another way of thinking about it is that they cancel each other out; theoretically, when two numbers cancel each other out, then their net sum is zero.
  This is not so with a contradiction or a paradox.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>
  A paradox is truth standing on its head to gain attention
  <span>— Oscar Wilde</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
  On one hand, a paradox manages to negate statements in a way which creates something greater than the sum of its parts.
  Two otherwise meaningless components are brought together to create something profound.
  Paradox in science is observed when phenomena act in ways contrary to contemporary theories, revealing flaws and forcing improvement.
  Paradox in philosophy is valuable in promoting critical thinking and depth of thought.
  Paradox in art, such as the work of <a class='link' href='https://mcescher.com/'>M.C. Escher</a>, depicts the impossible in complex, interesting and beautiful ways.
  Paradox in literature is used to describe the inexplicable, and can be traced from Shakespeare to almost every great writer.
  G.K. Chesterton was once described as the prince of paradox; Oscar Wilde used it as the cornerstone of his wit; George Orwell was the master of wielding paradox to make political points.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
  <p>
  All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others
  <span>— George Orwell, <i>Animal Farm</i></span></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
  Overall, paradox manages to bring together totally opposing things (reality and imagination, truth and fable, what is and what could be), to make something... profound.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  On the other hand, a contradiction is just ugly.
  Instead of creating something greater than the sum of its parts, or even balancing it out, a contradiction manages to create a situation which is ultimately <i>less</i> than the sum of its parts.
  A contradiction reveals a flaw in an opponents argument; even worse, contradiction is evidence of misinformation.
  From a personal view, sometimes a contradiction is just an accident waiting to happen - when you trip over your own words to enact a booby trap of your own creation.
  Other times contradiction is a trap set by someone else.
  However, over the course of our lifetimes we will undoubtably contradict ourselves in the ideas and beliefs which we carried.
  Contradiction in the moment is unacceptable, but contradiction over a long period of time is inevitable.
  Change is evidence of growth - sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse.
  The ability to change our point of view is one of the most stark examples of growth there is.
  </p>
  <p>
  Interestingly, this idea which I have laid out is a bit of a contradiction in and of itself; the idea that two statements which negate each other can create something either greater or lesser than the sum of their parts.
  Instead, I like to think of it more of a paradox...
  The paradox of contradiction.
